# 🧠 Tech Wearables Logic

Welcome to **Tech Wearables Logic**, a modular Python repository showcasing beginner-to-intermediate data analysis through realistic simulations of wearable device usage, user demographics, and sync performance. Every task is designed with professional structure and educational clarity — perfect for portfolio demonstrations, interviews, or further extension.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository captures the evolution of Python knowledge applied to tech usage analytics. From data cleaning to statistical reporting, each script reflects thoughtful structuring, consistent naming, and scalable design.

You'll find tasks that demonstrate:
- Structured data handling with `pandas`  
- Modular file separation with reusable functions  
- Device usage and error tracking simulation  
- Sync performance analysis and country-based insights  
- Runtime data analysis: averages, modes, standard deviation, IQR  

---

## 🧩 Modules Included

All scripts are located directly in the root folder of the project. Each `.py` file represents a step for this educational task:

| 📁 File | 🔎 Description |
|--------|----------------|
| `clean_wearable_data.py` | Cleans the dataset: removes missing values, converts types, and prepares data for analysis |
| `wearable_metrics.py` | Contains reusable functions for calculating key metrics like average usage, most common device, and error variation |
| `run_wearable_insights.py` | Main script that loads data, runs analysis, and prints results to the terminal |

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository  
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed  
3. Place `tech_wearables_data.csv` in the root folder  
4. Run the main script via terminal:

   `python run_wearable_insights.py`

5. Observe structured output including usage stats, device trends, and sync error analysis

## 💡 Concepts & Technologies Used

- Python 3 with `pandas` for data manipulation  
- Data cleaning: `dropna()`, `drop_duplicates()`, type conversion  
- Aggregation: `mean()`, `mode()`, `std()`, `quantile()`  
- Modular architecture with reusable functions  
- Formatted terminal output using `f-strings`  
- Clean file organization and analysis pipeline design
